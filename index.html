         <h2>Montana &rarr; Denver</h2>
         <p>I remember the exact moment in the summer of 2017 that I decided to I wanted to pedal a bike across country.
         </p>
         <p>I was sitting in a trail angel's home in Darby, Montana eating spaghetti he had made us while listening to
            some cyclists share their story of riding from Virginia Beach with the intent to reach the Oregon Coast.</p>
         <p>While I had completed a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail the year before, I was then attempting to
            thru-hike the Continental Divide Trail and already had 650 miles completed when I had made it to Darby. This
            notion of cycling that far blew me away.</p>
         <p>The next day it was time to get back on the trail. That year had massive fires all across the North West, so
            we had to reroute the next section, which added a couple of days to our plan of making it into Wyoming.
            Those next days cycling was all I thought. The urge was strong to change my direction for that summer.</p>
         <p>One morning, I decided I had walked enough and now needed to cycle back to Arkansas. I mean, if I changed my
            mind in a couple of days, I could always hitch and reconnect with the trail.</p>
         <p>But first thing first, I needed to get back to town.</p>
         <p>Back in Darby, I found the trail angel, David and asked for help finding a bike and a way back to Arkansas.
            He was shocked but excited and eager to whip out his map to help create a route.</p>
         <p>Later that evening I got a call about hiking the Colorado Trail and wasasked If I wanted to hike that before
            starting my cycling adventure, I obliged, "Yeah, Ill just find a bike in Denver", and booked a flight to
            Denver from Missoula. To my luck, a group that was cycling via Trans America was staying with the trail
            angel and had a friend driving an RV with them. They were headed to Missoula.</p>
         <p>When in Missoula, we had a day to waste before my flight and their cycling continued and went to the
            Adventure Cycling Association. Walking in, I immediately locked eyes with the bulleting board that had a
            bike for sale. The guy selling it for his wife worked at the ACA, it was my size, and price aligned with my
            budget. He even threw in a rack when he heard what I was doing. I'll take it.</p>

         <h2>Denver &rarr; Utah</h2>
         <p>Fast Foward. I had shipped the bike and hopped on a plane to Denver. There I took a train to Gunnison to
            meet up with Scooter at the trail head and hike the Colorado Trail down to Durango (yeah, I guess I still
            needed to walk some.)</p>
         <p>We hitched back to Denver just in time to catch Father John Misty at Red Rocks. Then I picked up my bike from
            a shop that was putting it back together, borrowed some panniers from a buddy Max, and got on a train
            headed to Grand Junction, Colorado. Putting together the route to get to Arkansas I decided that traveling through
            Kansas and Oklahoma didnt seem that fun and I wanted a view I hadnt seen before. So, I went with the long route of cycling through Utah, Arizona, Texas,
            Oklahoma to home in Arkansas.</p>
         <p>To be clear, I had never cycled more than 30 miles in a day before this trip. What the heck was I doing?  I had
            already been living the hiker trash lifestyle for a while, so living off gas station food and sleeping under
            the stars was nothing new, but riding a bike for miles on end every day was starting to feel intimidating.</p>
         <p>Starting off on my first day I encountered a route fail and found out I had to bike 107 miles on interstate with very few water stops.
            This would be the first and last centuty I would ever do. Arriving in Green River late in the afternoon, I realized being in the
            desert in August heat was going to be intense, and I was going to need lots of sunscreen. I adapted my schedule and started cycling at 6 am every morning.
            Taking a break from 1-4 and hitting the road again until I found a spot to watch the sun set and sleep. I
            was averaging about 60 miles a day. I stopped almost every 10 miles to admire the beauty of Utah. It was
            indeed a dream.</p>
         <p>Along the way, I went canyoneering through Goblin State Park, stayed on a goat farm(<a href="https://mesafarmmarket.com/" >Check them out here)</a>, hiked through Captial
            Reef, swam in the Fremont River, met up with Ninja, a friend that I made on the AT the previous year, in Escalante
            and we hiked Coyote Gulch. I then rode on to Bryce Canyon, where I spent a day hiking.
         <p>Zion National Park was my next stop, and I got a call from some folks saying they were on their way there, which ended up being
            a lifesaver because I got caught in a storm. They picked me up, and we spent a couple of days in the park,
            hiked the traverse, then rode through 35 mph winds into the Grand Canyon, where I made friends with a
            cyclist from Switzerland, who I convinced to hike down into the canyon with me. We rode out the next day
            together and split ways after 50 miles as he headed to Vegas.</p>
         <p>I then continued to the Colorado River, where I posted up for two nights before crossing into Arizona.</p>

         <h2>Utah &rarr; Arizona</h2>
         <p>Having cycled 850 miles, I made it to Flagstaff. While I was trying to grasp the reality of what the last
            month had been I received a call from my sister that she was about to have a baby in a week. I surely didn't
            want to miss that, so I decided to end my trip early and head home.</p>
         <p>Just as I was purchasing a bus ticket, I got a call from a friend asking where I was. He was close to
            Flagstaff, headed to Bentonville. (honestly, I couldn't make up how much the universe was working in my
            favor that summer).</p>
         <p>A day later, we are adventuring back to Bentonville the long way.</p>

         <h2> &rarr; Arkansas</h2>
         <p>NWA is home to amazing county roads that lead you through the Ozarks, rivers, and lakes. I try to spend as
            much time as I can finding new routes or convincing friends to bikepack.</p>
         <p>While hiking was what introduced me to the outdoors and built my up confidence. Cycling empowered me to push
            my limits further and open my mind up to new adventures. </p>
