         <h2>Montana &rarr; Denver</h2>
         <p>   In the summer of 2017, I was sitting in a trail angel's home in Darby, Montana eating spaghetti he had made
            us while in awe listening to some cyclists share their story of riding from Virginia Beach with the intent to
            reach the Oregon Coast. While I completed a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail the year before, I was then attempting to thru-hike
            the Continental Divide Trail and already had 650 miles completed when I had made it to Darby.<br>
            The next day it was time to get back on the trail. That year had massive fires all across the North West, so
            we had to reroute the next section, which added a couple of days to our plan of making it into Wyoming.
            The next two days, all I thought about was cycling and the strong urge to change my direction for that
            summer. One morning, I decided I had walked enough and now needed to cycle back to Arkansas. I mean, if I changed my
            mind in a couple of days, I could always hitch and reconnect with the trail. But first thing first, I needed to get
            back to town.<br> Back in Darby, I found the trail angel and asked for help finding a bike and a way back to Arkansas. He was shocked but excited and
            eager to whip out his map to help create a route. <br>Plans are always in motion and spur the moment, so when a friend hiking the Colorado Trail asked If I wanted
            to hike that before starting my cycling adventure, I obliged and booked a flight to Denver from Missoula. To my
            luck, a group that was cycling via Trans America wasstaying with the trail angel and had a friend driving an RV with
            them. They were headed to Missoula.<br>
            When in Missoula, we had a day to waste before my flight and their cycling continued and went to the Adventure Cycling Association. Walking in, I
            immediately locked eyes with the bulleting board that had a bike for sale. I had planned to purchase a bike in Denver, but
            the guy selling it for his wife worked at the ACA, it was my size, and price aligned with my budget. He even threw in a rack
            when he heard what I was doing. I'll take it.</p>

         <h2>Denver &rarr; Utah</h2>
         <p>Fast Foward. I had shipped the bike and hopped on a plane to Denver. There I took a train to Gunnison to
            meet up with Scooter at the trail head and hiked the Colorado Trail down to Durango (yeah, I guess I still needed
            to walk some.)<br>
            We hitched back to Denver just in time to catch Father John Misty at Red Rocks. Then picked up my bike from a bike shop that was putting it back together, borrowed some panniers from a buddy Max, and got on a train
            headed to Grand Junction, Colorado. Putting together the route to get home I decided that traveling through Kansas and Oklahoma didnt seem that
            fun. I went with the long route of cycling through Utah, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma to home in Arkansas. <br>FYI, I had never cycled more than 30
            miles in a day before this trip. What the heck was I doing? I had already been living the hiker trash lifestyle for a while, so living off gas station food and sleeping
            under the stars was nothing new. <br> My first day was a route fail and found out I had to bike 107 miles on interstate with very few water
            stops. This would be the first and last centuty I would ever do. Arriving in Green River I realized being in the desert in August heat was going to intense. I adapted my schedule and
            started cycling at 6 am every morning. Taking a break from 1-4 and hitting the road again until I found a
            spot to watch the sun set and sleep. I was averaging about 60 miles a day. I stopped almost every 10 miles to admire the beauty of Utah. It was indeed
            a dream.<br>
            Along the way, I went canyoneering through Goblin State Park, stayed on a goat farm, hiked through Captial
            Reef, swam in the Fremont River,met Ninja, a friend that I made on the AT the previous year, in Escalante, and we hiked
            Coyote Gulch. I then rode on to Bryce Canyon, where I spent a day hiking. Zion National Park was my next stop, and I got a call from some folks saying they were
            on their way there, which ended up being a lifesaver because I got caught in a storm. They picked me up, and we spent
            a couple of days in the park, hiked the traverse, then rode through 35 mph winds into the Grand Canyon, where I made
            friends with a cyclist from Switzerland, who I convinced to hike down into the canyon with me.We rode out the next day together and split ways after 50 miles as he headed to Vegas.
            I then continued to the Colorado River, where I stayed for two nights before crossing into Arizona.</p>

         <h2>Utah &rarr; Arizona</h2>
         <p>Having cycled 850 miles, I made it to Flagstaff. While I was trying to grasp the reality of what the last
            month had been I received a call from my sister that she was about to have a baby in a week. I surely didn't want to
            miss that, so I decided to end my trip early and head home.
            Just as I was purchasing a bus ticket, I got a call from a friend asking where I was. He was close to
            Flagstaff, headed to Bentonville. (honestly, I couldn't make up how the universe was working in my favor that summer)
            A day later, we are adventuring back to Bentonville the long way.</p>

         <h2> &rarr; Arkansas</h2>
            <p>Now you can find me in NWA on my gravel bike exploring the county roads or convincing my girlfriends to
            bikepack with me. While hiking was what introduced me to the outdoors and built my up confidence. Cycling empowered me to push
            the distance and extend my conscience on the adventure.</p>
