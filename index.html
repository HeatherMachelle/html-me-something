   <h1>Spontanious Cycling</h1>

   <p> In the summer of 2017, I was sitting in a trail angel's home in Darby, Montana eating spaghetti he had made us
      while in awe listening to some cyclists share their story of cycling from Virginia Beach with the intent to reach
      the Oregon Coast. While I completed a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail the year before, I was then attempting to
      thru-hike the Continental Divide Trail and already had 650 miles completed when I made it to Darby. </p>

   <p>The next day it was time to get back on the trail. That year had massive fires all across the North West, so we
      had to reroute the next section, which added a couple of days to our plan of making it into Wyoming.
      The next two days, all I thought about was cycling and the strong urge to change my direction for that summer.
   </p>

   <p>One morning, I decided I had walked enough and now needed to cycle back to Arkansas. I mean, if I changed my mind
      in a couple of days, I could always hitch and reconnect with the trail. But first thing first, I needed to get
      back to town.</p>

   <p>Back in Darby, I found the trail angel and asked for help finding a bike. He was shocked but excited and eager to
      whip out his map to help create a route home.

      Plans are always in motion and spur the moment, so when a friend hiking the Colorado Trail asked If I wanted to
      hike that before starting my cycling adventure. I obliged and booked a flight to Denver from Missoula. To my luck,
      a group was staying with the trail angel that was cycling via Trans America and had a friend driving an RV with
      them. They were headed to Missoula.


      When in Missoula, we had a day to waste time and went to the Adventure Cycling Association. Walking in, I
      immediately locked eyes with the bulleting board that had a bike for sale. I planned to purchase a bike in Denver,
      but the guy selling it for his wife worked at the ACA; my size and price aligned with my budget. He even threw in
      a rack when he heard what I was doing. I'll take it. </p>

   <p>Fast Foward. I had shipped the bike to Denver & hiked the Colorado Trail (yeah, I guess I still needed to walk
      some). I borrowed some panniers from a friend and got on a train headed to Grand Junction, Colorado, with my bike
      setting out to cycle through Utah, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma to home in Arkansas. </p>

   <p>FYI, I had never cycled more than 30 miles in a day before this trip. What the heck was I doing?


      I had already been living the hiker trash lifestyle for a while, so living off gas station food and sleeping under
      the stars was nothing new. It was the desert and August heat I had never endured before. I adapted my schedule and
      started cycling at 6 am every morning. Take a break from 1-4 and hit the road again until I found a sleep spot. I
      was averaging about 60 miles a day. I stopped almost every 10 miles to admire the beauty of Utah. It was indeed a
      dream.
   </p>

   <p>Along the way, I went canyoneering through Goblin State Park, stayed on a goat farm, hiked through Captial Reef,
      swam in the Fremont River, a friend met me in Escalante, and we hiked Coyote Gulch. I then rode on to Bryce
      Canyon, where I spent a day hiking. Zion National Park was my next stop, and I got a call from some folks saying
      they were on their way there, which ended up being a lifesaver because I got caught in a storm. They picked me up,
      and we spent a couple of days in the park, hiked the traverse, then rode through 35 mph winds into the Grand
      Canyon, where I made friends with a cyclist from Switzerland, who I convinced to hike down into the canyon with
      me.
      We rode out the next day together and split ways after 50 miles as he headed to Vegas.
      I then continued to the Colorado River, where I stayed for two nights before crossing into Arizona.
   </p>

   <p>Having cycled 850 miles, I made it to Flagstaff. While I was trying to grasp the reality of what my last month had
      been and received a call from my sister that she was about to have a baby in a week. I surely didn't want to miss
      that, so I decided to end my trip early and head home.

      Just as I was purchasing a bus ticket, I got a call from a friend asking where I was. He was close to Flagstaff,
      headed to Bentonville. (honestly, I couldn't make up how the universe was working in my favor that summer) </p>

   <p>A day later, we are adventuring back to Bentonville the long way.</p>

   <p>
      Now you can find me in NWA on my gravel bike exploring the county roads or convincing my girlfriends to backpack
      with me.
      While hiking was what introduced me to the outdoors and built my up confidence. Cycling empowered me to push the
      distance and extend my conscience on the adventure. </p>
